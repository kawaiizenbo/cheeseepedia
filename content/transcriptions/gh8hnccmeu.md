**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Hello again everyone. Well with this super fast pace of the jet age, what with supersonic
jets

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

And bullet trains

**Helen Henny:** 

And water skimming hydrofoil boats

**Pasqually:** 

It’s nice to see people slow down, kick back, and settle in on a more relaxed form of old fashioned transportation

**Mr. Munch:** 

Pasqually, I know what you mean

**Helen Henny:** 

I couldn’t agree with you more

**Pasqually:** 

Then why don’t we all start pedaling?

**Helen Henny:** 

I’m right behind you

**Pasqually:** 

Ok

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Daisy, Daisy, give him your answer due. 

He’s half crazy all for the love of you. 

It won’t be a stylish marriage, he can’t afford a carriage

**All:(Singing)** 

But you’ll look so sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two

**Pasqually:(Singing)** 

Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer due. 

I’m half crazy all for the love of you. 

It won’t be a stylish marriage, I can’t afford a carriage

**All:(Singing)** 

But you’ll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two

**Mr. Munch:** 

She loves me, she loves me not. She loves me, she loves me not

**Pasqually:** 

Munch, What are you doing?

**Mr. Munch:** 

Well, I’m in love and I’m just wanting to find out if she feels the same way about me

**Pasqually:** 

Oh, I know what you mean. I love to help Daisy pedal. Daisy pedal?

**Mr. Munch:** 

Daisy pedal 

**Pasqually:** 

It’s a joke, a flower joke

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Alright, guys. I got an idea

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Yeah?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

What do you say we borrow Helen’s daddy’s car and go cruise to the beach?

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Great idea

**Helen Henny:** 

Ooh, I can't wait to go

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Oh boy, what kind of car is it?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

A T Bird

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

I like it

**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)** 

Well, she got her daddy's car and she cruised to the hamburger stand, now. 

Seems she forgot all about the library like she told her old man, now. 

And with the radio blasting, going cruising just as fast as she can now. 

And she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away 

(Fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the T-bird away)

Well, the girls can't stand her 'cause she walks, looks and drives like an Ace, now 

(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace) 

She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race, now 

(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace) 

A lot of guys try to catch her, but she leads them on a wild goose chase, now 

(You drive like an Ace now, you drive like an Ace) 

And she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away 

(Fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the T-bird away) 

Well, you knew all along that your dad was getting wise to you, now 

(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)

And since he took your set of keys, you've been thinking that your fun is all through, now 

(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied) 

But you can come along with me because we've got a lot of things to do, now 

(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied) 

And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away 

(Fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away) 

And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away 

(Fun, fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-bird away) 

(Fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-bird away) 

(Fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-bird away) 

(Fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-bird away)

(Fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-bird away) 

(Fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-bird away) 

(Fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-bird away)
