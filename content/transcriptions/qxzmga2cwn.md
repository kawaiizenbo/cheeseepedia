**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Here’s a little ditty the band cooked up. We hope it’s your stamp of approval. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)**

You get a pen and some paper and write a little letter to tell me how you be. 

You tell me what is new and how do ya' do and fold the letter in half you see. 

You put the letter in an envelope, a stamp on the envelope, it makes me so happy. 

Now please don't fail to put your letter in the mail so the mailman can bring it to me. 

Hey!

**All:(Singing)** 

The mailman's bringin', 

he's bringin' my letters, 

he's bringin' my letters to me. 

Oh, the mailman's bringin', 

he's bringin' my letters, 

he's bringin' my letters to me. 

The mailman brings my letters, 

I feel so much better 

when he brings my letters to me. 

The mailman's bringin' my letters, 

he's bringin' my letters so send me two or three

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Alright, you ready for this? ‘

**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)**

With a smiling face they go place to place 

bringing mail to everyone. 

In rain or snow it's off they go 

until their work is done. 

Bringing pictures and magazines, 

postcards and toys, 

and sometimes bills galore. 

During holiday season 

whatever the reason the mail comes to your door

**All:(Singing)** 

Oh, the mailman's bringin', 

he's bringin' my letters, 

he’s bringin' my letters to me. 

Oh, the mailman's bringin', 

he's bringin' my letters, 

he's bringin' my letters to me

**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)** 

Over hill and dale, 

all types of mail, 

He brings my letters to me. 

Cause I don't have a phone, 

I hear from back home and he's bringing my letters to me. 

Look, here's a couple.. 

My best friend Nick heard I was sick, 

dropped a note to say get well. 

And the new girl Shirley, 

with her hair so curly, really thinks I'm swell. 

My old pal Davey, 

you know the one in the Navy, 

says he'll be home real soon. 

And we'll all holler when we win the million dollar sweepstakes this afternoon

**All:(Singing)** 

Oh, the mailman's bringin', 

he's bringin' my letters, 

he's bringin' my letters to me. 

Oh, the mailman's bringin', 

he's bringin' my letters, 

he's bringin' my letters to me

**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)** 

We'll have a nice talk when he comes down the walk to say “Hello” to me

**All:(Singing)** 

The mailman's bringin', 

he’s bringin' my letters, 

he’s bringin' my letters to me. 

The mailman's bringin' my letters, 

he’s bringin' my letters, 

he’s bringin' my letters to me. 

Oh, the mailman's bringin', 

he’s bringin' my letters, 

he’s bringin' my letters to me. 

The mailman brings my letters, 

I feel so much better when he brings my letters to me

**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)** 

The mailman's bringin' my letters, 

he's bringin' my letters. 

He's always on time, 

he couldn't be better. 

Cause my mailman's a real go-getter

**All:(Singing)** 

Bringin’ my letters to me

**Chuck E. Cheese:(Singing)** 

To me! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yep, no rain, nor snow, nor sleet, no hail will stop the mailman from-

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Yeah, especially if he’s delivering bills

**Mr. Munch:** 

But listen up, I’ve got a great way to handle that

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Oh?

**Mr. Munch:** 

You see, when the mailman comes to my door I say “Hey, are those bills?” and if he said yeah then I say “Then send em on back, my name is definitely not bill.”

**Helen Henny:** 

And what do you do if that doesn’t work?

**Mr. Munch:** 

Why, then I make tracks

**Helen Henny:** 

You mean you run away?

**Mr. Munch:** 


No, I mean I make tracks. Railroad tracks. It just relaxes me to lay down those steel rails and swing that big old sledgehammer

**Pasqually:** 

Nothing personal, Munch. But I think your train of thought has derailed

**Mr. Munch:** 

What, you don’t believe me? Just listen while I put the hammer down. 

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)**

I’ve been working on the railroad 

All the livelong day. 

I’ve been working on the railroad 

just to pass the time away.

Don't you hear the whistle blowing? 

Rise up so early in the morn. 

Don’t you hear the captain shouting “Dinah, blow your horn!”? 

Well, Dinah won’t you blow, 

Dinah won’t you blow, 

Dinah won’t you blow your horn? 

Dinah won’t you blow, 

Dinah won’t you blow, 

Dinah won’t you blow that horn? 

Jasper!

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

I’ve been working on the railroad all the livelong day

**Mr. Munch:** 

Alright, miss Helen

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

I’ve been working on the railroad just to pass, to pass the time away

**Mr. Munch:** 

Pasqually, you give it a shot

**Pasqually:(Singing)** 

Thanks. Can’t you hear the whistle blowing, blowing. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Rise up so early in the morning

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

Don’t you hear that captain shouting “Well Dinah, come blow your horn!”?

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

Dinah, won’t you blow

**Pasqually:(Singing)** 

Dinah, won’t you blow

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Dinah, won’t you blow your horn?

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

Dinah, won’t you blow, 

Dinah won’t you blow, 

Dinah won’t you blow your horn?
