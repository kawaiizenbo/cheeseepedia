**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

A lot of people smile for no reason this season

**Chuck E. Cheese & Helen Henny:** 

And everywhere the air is electric. It’s majestic

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Something seems to happen after turkey day, 

people move and grooving in a different

way and it’s kind of catchy once they start to say

**All:** 

Merry Christmas, my friend. 

Share the joy 

and the spirit of the season

**Pasqually:** 

Come on

**All:** 

Share the joy 

with everyone you meet

**Helen Henny:** 

If everyone could share like you 

then all the world will shine like new

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Remember Mr. Scrooge and his money? 

He acted funny

**Chuck E. Cheese & Helen Henny:** 

When Christmas morning came 

he was a new man, 

he had a better plan

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Oh Mr. Scrooge was not the only guy 

who saw the guiding light out of a  snowy sky. 

You can feel the magic if you close your eyes

**All:** 

And let the love pour right in. 

Share the joy 

and the spirit of the season. 

Share the joy 

with everyone you meet

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Hi there, friend

**Helen Henny & Jasper T. Jowls:** 

If everyone can like you 

then all the world would shine like new

**All:** 

Share the joy and the spirit of the season. 

Share the joy with everyone you meet. 

If everyone can share like you 

then all the world would shine like new

**Pasqually:** 

Now there’s a Christmas song that’s really cooking, and I should know. I’m a cook

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 


But now let’s sing some traditional old fashioned rock and roll

**Pasqually:** 

Rocking around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop. 

Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop. 

Rocking around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring. 

Later we’ll have some pumpkin pie and we’ll do some caroling

**Helen Henny:** 

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear 

voices singing “Let's be jolly. Deck the halls with boughs of holly.”

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Rocking around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday. 

Everyone’s dancing merrily

**All:** 

In the new old fashioned way

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Wow, what a bodacious tune, guys

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Well, Charlie Rockit, coming from you I’ll take that as a great compliment

**Charlie Rockit:** 

No problem, Chuck. One favor though

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Yeah?

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Can I do the band introduction this time?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Well that’s usually my job but seeing how it’s the holiday season and such

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Here they are, everybody. Helen Henny, Pasqually, Jasper Jowls, Mr. Munch, and the star of our show, Chuck E. Cheese

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Thanks, Charlie

**Charlie Rockit:** 

You’re welcome, Chuck. And oh, have a happy holiday

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Happy holiday to you too, Charlie. And to all of you out there, have a great holiday season. Back in a bit
