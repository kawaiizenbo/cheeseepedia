Hold it. Question, question

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Charlie Rockit, what can I help you with?

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Hey Chuck E., is it possible to go faster than the speed of sound in a bus?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Well Charlie, I hardly doubt it unless you’ve got some secret additive you could throw in with the gas

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Well Chuck E., as a matter of fact I do

**Mr. Munch:** 

You do?

**Helen Henny:** 

Wow, what do you call it?

**Charlie Rockit:** 

Rocket fuel

**Helen Henny:** 

Woah

**Charlie Rockit:(Singing)** 

Revvin' up your engine, listen to her howlin' roar. 

Metal under tension beggin' you to touch and go. 

Highway to the Danger Zone. Ride into the Danger Zone. 

Headin' into twilight. Spreadin' out her wings tonight. 

She got you jumpin' off the deck and shovin' into overdrive

Highway to the Danger Zone. I'll take you right into the Danger Zone. 

You'll never say hello to you until you get it on the red line overload. 

You'll never know what you can do until you get it up as high as you can go. 

Out along the edges, always where I burn to be. 

The further on the edge, the hotter the intensity. 

Highway to the Danger Zone. 

Gonna take it right into the Danger Zone. 

Highway to the Danger Zone. 

Ride into the Danger Zone. 

Highway to the Danger Zone.

Gonna take it right into the Danger Zone. 

Highway to the Danger Zone. 

Ride into the Danger Zone
