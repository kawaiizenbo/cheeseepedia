**Pasqually:** 

Oh, goodness me. I just barely ran in from the kitchen in time to start our show. I tell
you it’s tough holding down two jobs at once around here. 

**Pasqually:(Singing)**

Some days won't end ever and some days pass on by. 

I'll be working here forever, at least until I die. 

It’s tough if you do and tough if you don't. 

I'm supposed to get a raise next week, you know I probably won't. 

Workin' for a livin'.

Workin' for a livin'. 

Workin' for a livin', 

livin' and workin'. 

I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'. 

I am an operator 'cause I really need the work, 

and with Chuck E. always callin’ me, I’m going just berserk. 

Hundred dollar phone bill, two hundred rent. 

I get my check on Friday, but it's already spent. 

Workin' for a livin’. 

Workin' for a livin'. 

Workin' for a livin',

livin' and workin'. 

I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'

(Ooh, workin' for a livin'. Ooh, taking what they giving. Ooh, workin' for a livin'. Ooh)

**Pasqually:** 

Oh yes, It’s like we pizza cooks always say. If you can’t take the heat

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Stay out of the kitchen?

**Pasqually:** 

Eh, no not exactly, Chuck E. We say, if you can’t take the heat, don’t shake those little
red peppers on your pizza. Ooh, they’re hot. 

**Pasqually:(Singing)**

Bus boy, bartender, cookin’ pizza pies. 

Grease monkey, plumber, or the winner of the fight. 

Whatever you do, it's really all the same. 

Singin’ soul, rock n' roll, any other game.

Workin' for a livin'. 

Workin' for a livin'. 

Workin' for a livin',

livin' and workin'. 

I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'

(Ooh, workin' for a livin'. Ooh, taking what they giving. Ooh, workin' from nine to five)

**Pasqually:** 

Yes, with all the work I do around here it’s a dog’s life

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Ooh, you’re barking up the wrong tree, Pasqually. I’ll tell you about working hard.

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)**

Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen. 

Pour myself a cup of ambition. 

Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life. 

Jump in the shower, the blood starts pumpin'. 

Out on the streets the traffic starts jumpin'. 

With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5. 

Working 9 to 5. 

What a way to make a living. 

Barely gettin' by. 

It's all taking and no giving. 

They just use your mind

and they never give you credit. 

It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. 

9 to 5, for service and devotion. 

You would think that I 

would deserve a better promotion. 

Want to move ahead, 

But the boss won't seem to let me. 

I swear sometimes they’re all out to get me. 

They let you dream just to watch them shatter. 

You're just a step on the boss man's ladder. 

But you got dreams he'll never take away. 

You’re in the same boat with a lot of your friends. 

Waiting for the day your ship will come in, 

and the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll you away. 


Working 9 to 5. 

What a way to make a living. 

Barely gettin' by. 

It's all taking and no giving. 

They just use your mind and they never give you credit. 

It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it. 

9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you. 


There's a better life and you think about it don't you. 

It's a rich man's game, no matter what you call it. 

And you spend your life putting money in his pocket

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Let’s hear it for Jasper T. Jowls, the hardest working dog in showbiz. In fact, I think he’s the only working dog in showbiz. Hey, we’ll be back in a little bit. See you later
