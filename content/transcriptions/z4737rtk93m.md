**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

That’s right. We wanna give you a sneak preview of what you may hear on Christmas Eve

**All:** 

Here we come a caroling among the lights so bright. 

With Chuck E. and the guys are going to sing for your delight. 

Love and joy come to you, and to you good Christmas too. 

And we’ll bless you and send you a happy new year 

and we wish you a happy new year.  

Pasqually takes the  high part and he sings it very sweet,

 he almost sounds like uncle Johnny’s singing parakeet. 

Love and joy come to you and to you good Christmas too. 

And we’ll bless you and send you a happy new year 

and we wish you a happy new year

**Mr. Munch:** 

Hey, why do they call these songs Christmas carols?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

I don’t know, but if I see Carol I’ll ask her

**All:** 

Then there’s Jasper and Chuck E. both switching off the leads 

and in between the phrases they perform with Christmas deeds. 

Love and joy come to you, and to you good Christmas too.

And we’ll bless you and send you a happy new year 

and we wish you a happy new year. 

Crooning low it’s Mr. Munch he’s singing low on bass

**Mr. Munch:** 

And with my mellow bellows, I’m sure will rock the place

**All:** 

Love and joy come to you, and to you good Christmas too. 

And we’ll bless you and send you a happy new year 

and we wish you a happy, happy new year

**Helen Henny:** 

Do you believe in magic? I do because Christmas magic is all around. It turns frowns into smiles, it turns plain houses into rainbows and it touches the hearts of everyone we know and love. 

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

City sidewalks, 

busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style. 

In the air there’s a feeling of Christmas. 

Children laughing, people passing. 

Meeting smile after smile, 

and on every street corner you’ll hear. 

Silver bells. 

Silver bells. 

It’s Christmas time in the city. 

Ring a ling. 

Hear them ring. 

Soon it will be Christmas Day. 

Strings of street lights, 

even stop lights 

blink of bright red and green 

as the shoppers rush home 

with their treasures. 

Hear the snow crunch, 

see the kids bunch. 

This is Santa's big scene 

and above all this bustle you hear. 

Silver bells

**All:** 

Silver bells

**Helen Henny:** 

Silver bells

**All:** 

Silver bells

**Helen Henny:** 

It’s Christmas time in the city

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

We’ll be back in a bit with more yuletide fun. And we hope you’ll be here too. See you soon!
