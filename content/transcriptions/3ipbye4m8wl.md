**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Hi there, everybody. And happy holidays

**Helen Henny:** 

Happy holidays

**Mr. Munch:** 

This year I want a pile of presents

**Helen Henny:** 

Have you been good all year?

**Mr. Munch:** 

Good? Hey, I didn’t know there were any rules to this game

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

There are only a few and they’re easy to remember. 

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)**

You better watch out, you better not cry. 

You better not pout, I’m telling you why. 

Santa Claus is coming to town. 

Santa Claus is coming to town. 

Santa Claus is coming to town. 

He’s making a list, he’s checking it twice. 

He’s gonna find out who’s naughty and nice. 

Santa Claus is coming to town. 

Santa Claus is coming to town. 

Santa Claus is coming to town. 

He sees you when you’re sleeping, 

he knows when you’re awake. 

He knows if you’ve been bad or good 

so you better be good for goodness sake

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch & Pasqually:** 

You better be good for goodness sake

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

You better watch out, you better not cry. 

You better not pout, I’m telling you why

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch & Pasqually:** 

 Santa Claus is coming to town. Santa Claus is coming to town

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Santa Claus is coming to town

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch & Pasqually:** 

Santa Claus is coming to town. Santa Claus is coming to town

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Santa Claus is coming to town. 

He sees you when you’re sleeping, 

He knows when you’re awake. 

He knows if you’ve been bad or good so you better be good for goodness sake

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch & Pasqually:** 

You better be good for goodness sake

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

You better watch out, you better not cry. 

You better not pout, I’m telling you why

**Helen Henny & Mr. Munch & Pasqually:** 

Santa Claus is coming to town. 

Santa Claus is coming to town

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Santa Claus is coming to town

**Pasqually:** 

Oh, he’s coming to all the homes in all the towns in all the world

**Mr. Munch:** 

Say, isn’t that a line from Casablanca?

**Helen Henny:** 

Munch, you watch too many late movies

**Mr. Munch:** 

I’m just training to stay up late waiting for Santa

**Pasqually:** 

Well, the wait is almost over

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

That’s right, cause Santa will be on his way in the wink of an eye. And  does everyone here know how Santa gets around?
**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Sure, in a sleigh pulled by magical reindeer

**All:** 

Yeah

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

And as a special surprise guest, we’ve got everybody’s favorite reindeer here today

**All:** 

Wow

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

There's just one problem, he’s really shy. But maybe, just maybe if you all help sing the next song, he might come out to say “Hi” in his quiet sweet shy little way

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Isn’t that nice

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen. 

Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen. 

But do you recall the most famous reindeer of em all? 

Rudolph the red nosed reindeer

had a very shiny nose 

and if you ever saw it 

you would even say it glows. 

All of the other reindeer

used to laugh and call him names. 

They never let poor Rudolph 

join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve, 

Santa he came to say

**Chuck E. Cheese & Kids:** 

Rudolph with your nose so bright

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

**Chuck E. Cheese & Kids:** 

Then how the reindeer loved him. 

As they shouted out with glee 

“Rudolph the red nosed reindeer, you’ll go down in history”

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Let’s hear it for Rudolph the red nosed reindeer, ladies and gentlemen. Yay. Alright, one more time

**All:** 

Rudolph the red nosed reindeer 

had a very shiny nose. 

Rudolph the red nosed reindeer,

you’ll go down in history

**Chuck E. Cheese:** (simultaneously) 

Yeah, Rudolph the red nose- Rudolph the re- Uh, ok, Rudy- Ok. Rudolph, we really need to get on with the show. Rudolph. Rudolph. Uh, let’s go. We’ll be back, see you later
