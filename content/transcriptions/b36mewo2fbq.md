**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Welcome back, folks. Oh by the way, I wanted to mention that I almost put a new roof on
my new convertible car

**All:** 

Oh yeah?

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Too much overhead

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Stop, that’s terrible

**Pasqually:** 

That was really awful

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Guess we should’ve known 

by the way he parked his car sideways 

that he didn’t want a scratch. 

Chrome was shining bright, 

you could see that car at night. 

They say that it’s really cool.

So I said to Chuck E. “Let’s go for a ride.” 

You know we got nothing to lose. 

And it was Saturday night, the car was out of sight 

and he says “Come on, let's go cruise.” 

And I said “Little red corvette. Chuck E., don’t go too fast.” 

Little red corvette, Chuck E., we’re gonna have a blast.

Guess we should’ve closed our eyes 

when you drove us to the place where your band plays for free. 

Cause we felt a little chill when we heard the pounding beat. 

It was the happening place to be.

 Believe it or not, we ate in a hurry. 

But the place had class. 

And it was Saturday night, the car was out of sight. 

I said “Chuck E., have you got enough gas?” 

Little red corvette, Chuck E., don’t go too fast. 

Little red corvette. 

Chuck E. Cheese, we’re gonna have a blast. 

Little red corvette.

Chrome was shining bright, 

you could see that car at night. 

They say that it’s really cool. 

And it was Saturday night, 

the car was out of sight 

and he says “Come on, let's go cruise.” 

And I said “Little red corvette. Chuck E., don’t go too fast.” 

Little red corvette, Chuck E. Cheese, we’re gonna have a blast. 

Little red corvette, Chuck E., don’t go too fast. 

Little red corvette, Chuck E. Cheese, we’re gonna have a blast. 

Chuck E. Cheese, we’re gonna have a blast

**Pasqually:** 

You know, I love to travel by plane, by car, but my favorite way is by train

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Mine too

**Pasqually:** I

t goes a little slower so you get to see a lot more

**Mr. Munch:** 

Yeah, there’s nothing like going to sleep with the sound of the rickety rackety rolling of
those wheels

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Mr. Engineer, can I take a ride with you? 

You know that’s something I’ve always wanted to do
