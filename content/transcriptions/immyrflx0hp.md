**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Hi, everybody and welcome to our show. I’m Chuck E. Cheese and this is Munch’s Make
Believe Band, the hardest working band in showbiz

**All:** 

Hi

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

And since we’re really working for all of you, that means we’ve got a bodaciously good job

**Helen Henny:** 

We sure do

**Mr. Munch:** 

Hey, but we don’t need your money. All we want is for you to give us a hand at the end of the show

**Pasqually:** 

Because wherever you work, hands are very important

**Mr. Munch:** 

That’s right

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Working in the classroom, or working hard at having fun. 

Meeting down at Chuck E.’s place when our handy work is done. 

So put those hands together, yeah let’s all lend a hand. 

Let’s all give a big applause to our friends in Munch’s band

**All:(Singing)** 

Oh these hands

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Are working hard for you. 

Making this a better world, 

helping dreams come true

**All:(Singing)** 

Oh these hands

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Working on the computer or playing basketball. 

Jamming on piano,  guitar, or drums, 

or giving your friends a call. 

Tossing around a football or clapping to the beat, 

even cooking up some pizza or something good to eat

**All:(Singing)** 

Oh these hands

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Are working hard for you. 

Building up a better world, 

helping dreams come true

**All:(Singing)** 

Oh these hands

**All:(Singing)** 

Working hard all day

**Helen Henny:(Singing)** 

Doing just an honest job

**All:(Singing)** 

For some money’s pay

**Jasper T. Jowls:(Singing)** 

And every job has its own rewards and it comes with its own demands. 

If you really want to feel some pride and some pleasure that comes with a job well done

**All:(Singing)** 

With these hands

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Alright now, listen up. We want you to take your hands and join with our hands to make these hands go to work. Yeah, let’s go. Alright. Now you got it. Take it, guys

**All:(Singing)** 

Oh these hands

Working hard all day

**Helen Henny:** 

Making this a better place, 

a better place to stay

**All:(Singing)** 

Oh these hands. Oh these hands. 

Oh these hands. Oh these hands

**Mr. Munch:** 

You know, that song reminds me of what I like best about hard work

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

And what’s that?

**Mr. Munch:** 

Quitting time

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Oh

**Mr. Munch:** 

Oh yeah, at the end of the work day I like to get together with all my friends and let my hair down

**Jasper T. Jowls:** 

Ooh

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

And with your hair that’s a job in itself

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

I got ketchup on my furry knee, I just burnt my hand. 

Boy, it's hard to be a piano man

**All:(Singing)** 

I never learned to cook and I don’t know how to clean

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

But I eat a lot of pizza, if you know what I mean

**All:(Singing)** 

I got to get ready, make everything right

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

Cause all my fuzzy friends are coming over tonight

**All:(Singing)** 

Do you wanna dance?

**Mr. Munch:** 

Yeah

**All:(Singing)** 

Do you want to party?

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

Now listen, this is big Munch 

ready to get the things started. 

Yeah. We’ll shake the

**All:(Singing)** 

Earth and the ground, 

put some soft drinks on ice

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

Cause all my fuzzy friends are coming over tonight. 

**Mr. Munch:**

Boy, have I got a lot to do. I  gotta go grocery shopping, I don’t have a thing. Woah, I gotta clean first! Look at this dust. And vacuum. My oh my. 

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Now my party pad is out in the woods. 

It's a long, long way from here to Hollywood. 

I now got a fuzzy hand dancing on the floor and look, 

Mr. Chuck E. Cheese just walked in the door

**All:(Singing)** 

I got a gas grill cooking things for us to eat

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

You can have something good or you can have something sweet. You can

**All:(Singing)** 

Do anything that you want to do

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)** 

But uh uh, don't you step on my big green shoes. Well

**All:(Singing)** 

Do you wanna dance?

**Mr. Munch:**

**All:(Singing)** 

Do you want to party?

**Mr. Munch:(Singing)**
